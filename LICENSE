### Presentation Materials:

Here's a breakdown of the **Presentation** 

#### 1. **Title Slide**
   - Title: *Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and XGBoost*
   - Subtitle: *A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Time Series Forecasting*

#### 2. **Background**
   - Discuss the importance of stock price prediction.
   - Challenges: Complexity of time series data, market volatility, and finding the right model.

#### 3. **Data Analysis Results**
   - Mention the results of the EDA. Highlight trends, seasonality, and identified missing values.
   - Data preprocessing steps taken.

#### 4. **Technical Overview**
   - LSTM model: Why it was chosen for handling sequential data.
   - XGBoost: Chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets.
   - Mention the dropout and other regularization techniques used in LSTM.

#### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), training time.
   - LSTM: Better accuracy but slower training.
   - XGBoost: Faster training, suitable for lower computation resources.

#### 6. **Verification Content**
   - Hypothesis 1: Using LSTM will provide the most accurate predictions over long-term training.
   - Hypothesis 2: XGBoost will give comparable results in fewer boosting rounds.

#### 7. **Verification Result 1**
   - Results of LSTM: Show performance over 200 epochs.
   - Highlight MSE, loss reduction, and final accuracy.

#### 8. **Verification Result 2**
   - Results of XGBoost: Faster convergence with similar accuracy.
   - Show performance with 100 boosting rounds.

#### 9. **Summary**
   - LSTM: Suitable for more complex and longer sequences, but requires more time and computation.
   - XGBoost: Effective for faster predictions with less computational demand.
   - Future work: Exploring other models (ARIMA, Prophet, LightGBM, Transformers) and hyperparameter tuning for even better performance.
